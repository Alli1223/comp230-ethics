\abstract{Crowdfunding has become increasingly popular as a way to fund game development in recent years, this paper reviews if this method of financing effects the game project negatively, furthermore is crowdfunding a viable alternative to traditional publishers?}

\section{Introduction}

Are kickstarted projects 

How successful are the kickstarted games compared to games funded by publishers?

Publishers put pressure on developers to get the game done by a set date, where as kickstarter does not put pressure on developers, this means that games these days are spending more time in the ``early access'' stage rather than being finished.
% This is partly due to the internet and being able to update players games remotely, rather than putting it on a disk.

% This paper will reflect on several of the most popular crowdfunded games projects and 

%Subtopics:
%Does having a crowdfunded game project decrease productivity of developers compared to a company financed by a publisher?
%(not delivering on promises to backers.)
%(Should there be a mechanism in place to let players know if the studio is in trouble, and if development is likely to continue?)
%(how successful is the early access model?)
%(Is early access ruining the quality of games?)
