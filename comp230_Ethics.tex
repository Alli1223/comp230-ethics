\abstract{Crowdfunding has become increasingly popular as a way to fund game development in recent years, this paper reflects how games are marketed in crowdfunding and the ethics of not delivering on promises to backers.}

\section{Introduction}
Crowdfunding has become a new popular way to fund video games as Kickstarter alone has provided funding for over 450 video game projects (as of 2013) \cite{Harris:2013}. %However many of those game projects are still in development and have not delivered on a lot of their promses.

This paper will compare a few recent game projects and analyze what they promised they were going to deliver and see what they actually delivered.
\begin{itemize}

\item  \textbf{Game One: Star Citizen}
\item  \textbf{Game Two : Elite: Dangerous}
\item  \textbf{Game Three: Planteary Annihilation}
\item  \textbf{Game Four: Godus}
\end{itemize}

Do crowdfunded projects over scope to gain money for a project, when they don't intend to deliver?

The backers often refer to themselves as ``investors'' in corwdfunded games, however this is not true because they do not gain a profit from the video game. Other times backers are considered to have pre-ordered the game.

Some crowdfunded games often increase the scope of the game after the game gets more funding, which in-turn sets back the release date of the game. A particularly egregious example of this is ``Star Citizen'' \cite{kickstarterStarCitizen}. This title asked for £2.0M in funding, but as of November 2016 it has recieved over £132.5M. However this means that the scope of their game has increased remarkably and pushed the release date of the game back significantly (TODO: Find source for dates).

\section{Comparing what some games projects delivered compared to what they promised}

A study found that most kickstarted projects manage to deliver their products, around 91\% of all kickstarted projects succeed \cite{mollick2015}.
